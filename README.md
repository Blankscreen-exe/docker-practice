# Docker Practice

My practice with docker where I try out all sorts of things. This repository contains byte-sized tutorials revolving around `Docker`.

You can learn from it as well since I have categorized everything and have written clean code. Everything in there is well-documented.

> 📌 Each tutorial will be found inside a separate folder (with prefix `000.` where `000` can by any number)
